# HiTMapper


## Installation
It's easiest to install HiTMapper with the help of the `devtools` package.

`install.packages("devtools") # if necessary`  
`devtools::install_github("matei-ionita/HiTMapper")`

## Summary
Mapper is an algorithm developed for topological data analysis, originally due to [[1]](#1). It constructs a graph which approximates the (hypothetical) landscape from which data points are sampled. HiTMapper is an implementation which is tailored to cytometry data: for example, only using subroutines that run in linear time, so that millions of data points can be processed in a few minutes.

Each node in the Mapper graph represents multiple data points, resulting in a compact visualization of the dataset. Crucially, the nodes are fine-grained, not meant to represent distinct phenotypes, but rather subtly different cell states. This enables the visualization of hundreds of detailed cell states in a relational framework. We can also use the graph to provide a warm start for traditional clustering, using the Leiden method[[2]](#2) for community detection.
