# flowMapper


## Installation
It's easiest to install flowMapper with the help of the `devtools` package.

`install.packages("devtools") # if necessary`  
`devtools::install_github("matei-ionita/flowMapper")`

## Summary
Mapper is an algorithm inspired by topological data analysis, originally due to [[1]](#1). It constructs a graph which approximates the (hypothetical) space from which data points are sampled. This implementation makes design choices which are suitable for flow cytometry data: for example, only using subroutines that run in linear time, so that millions of data points can be processed in a few minutes.

Each node in the Mapper graph represents multiple data points, resulting in a compact visualization of the dataset. But the graph is more than the visualization. For example, we use the Leiden method[[2]](#2) to detect communities in the graph, which can then be interpreted as cell phenotypes.
